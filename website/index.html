Each year, the culmination of millions of people voting for their favorite movie stars, producers, directors and film scores will be the induction of those winners into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame.<br>
    <br>
    Election Procedures<br>
The Motion Picture Hall of Fame has established the Motion Picture Hall of Fame as an institution devoted to recognition and honoring of noteworthy individuals, movies and film scores for their outstanding contributions to the motion picture industry. The purpose of this section is to state the guidelines to the Hall of Fame selection process.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nomination of candidates</li>
    <li>Election of inductees</li>
  </ul>

  The nominating committee is vested with the responsibility of selecting nominees for induction to the Motion Picture Hall of Fame. Membership electors, through the use of Internet-based ballots will select inductees into the Hall of Fame from the list of nominees brought forward by the Nomination committee.<br>
  <br>
  Nomination Committee<br>
The Motion Picture Hall of Fame has gathered a group of celebrities to serve as a Celebrity Advisory Committee.
