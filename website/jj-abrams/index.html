  <h1>J.J Abrams</h1>
  <p>Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, better known to his fans as J.J. Abrams, is an American film and television producer, director, actor and screenwriter. He specializes in the science fiction and action genres and is most famous for his work in films like &lsquo;Star Trek, and &lsquo;Mission Impossible III&rsquo;, and television shows like &lsquo;Alias&rsquo; and &lsquo;Felicity.&rsquo; He developed an early interest in film making which was only natural as his father is also a television producer. As a college student he co-wrote a film treatment with Jill Mazursky which was purchased by Touchstone Pictures and eventually made into a film titled, &lsquo;Taking Care of Business.&rsquo; The film did not do well and it took Abrams some more years to find a firm footing in the industry. He ultimately found his big breakthrough with the television drama series &lsquo;Felicity&rsquo; which he co-created with Matt Reeves. The show became extremely popular and earned several nominations and awards, and also established Abrams&rsquo;s reputation as a screenwriter. The show&rsquo;s success led him to create an action series for the television titled &lsquo;Alias&rsquo; which ran for five seasons on ABC. The show was ranked among the "the 50 greatest TV shows of all time." He started writing, directing and producing movies along with television shows and proved his versatility and talents to the world with his &lsquo;Mission: Impossible III.&rsquo;<br>
